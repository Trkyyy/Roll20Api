# Roll20Api
Apis for Roll20


Psychic Phenomena roller:

To use simply add this script to your Roll20 game and use the '!psyp' command

CritTable is also working, format is !crit + CritWoundLevel + DamageType(X,I,R,E) + HitLocation(H,A,B,L) e.g. '!crit 2 X H' will return 'The flash and noise leaves the target Blinded and Deafened for 1 round.'

Should work just fine, let me know if you have any issues. 

ScatterTable will just roll 1d10 and grab the value from the scatter table, very lightweight, use !scat 

I am currently working on being able to input willpower modifier into the Psychic Phenomena roller and it will show you what options you can adjust to. Still a WIP

My discord tag is Turkey#7110
